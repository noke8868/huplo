# huplo
an attempt at making a **H**eads **U**p **P**ot **L**imit **O**maha AI.

## Description
Heads-up PLO AI using Monte Carlo Tree Search.
Potentially will include a preflop range constructor which would learn what sorts of hands are playable.
This might also make the AI horrible and unusable.

The default raking is based on PokerStars .5/1 heads-up PLO rake.

## Notes
use python2

preflop\_constructor.py requires anaconda (python2) to run correctly.

## To-Do List
* Use a non-preconfigured deck to avoid AI cheating
* Test huplo.py
* Use learning to construct preflop ranges
* Make a learning based AI (?)
